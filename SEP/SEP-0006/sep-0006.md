## Motivation

A `LATERAL` join is like a for-each loop, looping on the results from the left-hand side (LHS),
the pattern before the `LATERAL` keyword, and executing the right-hand side (RHS) query pattern
once for each row, with the variables from the RHS in-scope during each RHS evaluation.

A regular join only executes the RHS once, and the variables from the LHS are only used for the
join condition after evaluation of the left and right sub-patterns.

Another way to think of a lateral join is as a `flatmap`.

Examples:
```sparql
## Get exactly one label for each subject in a row.
SELECT * {
   ?s ?p ?o
   LATERAL {
     SELECT * { ?s rdfs:label ?label } LIMIT 1
   }
}
```

```sparql
## Get zero or one labels for each subject.
SELECT * {
   ?s ?p ?o
   LATERAL { OPTIONAL { SELECT * { ?s rdfs:label ?label } LIMIT 1} }
}
```
`{ OPTIONAL ...` is the same as writing `{ {} OPTIONAL ...`.
`{ }` evaluates to the join identity, a table of one row of zero columns.

### Syntax

The `LATERAL` keyword which has the graph pattern so far (from the `{` starting the current
block) and a `{ }` block afterwards. 

### Scope

A sub-select may have variables of the same name that are not lateral-joined to a variable
of that name from the LHS.

```sparql
SELECT * {
   ?s ?p ?o
   LATERAL {
     SELECT ?label { ?s rdfs:label ?label } LIMIT 1
   }
}
```
The inner `?s` in the `SELECT ?label` is not the outer `?s`, because the `SELECT ?label`
does not pass out `?s`. As a sub-query, the `?s` could be any name except `?label` for
the same results.

This is the same situation as a sub-query in other situations.

There needs to be a new syntax restriction: there can be no variable introduced by `AS`
(`BIND`, or sub-query) or `VALUES` in-scope at the top level
scope of the `LATERAL` RHS, that has the same name as any
[in-scope](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#variableScope) variable from the LHS.

```sparql
## ** Illegal **
SELECT * {
   ?s ?p ?o
   LATERAL { BIND( 123 AS ?o) }
}
```

See [SPARQL Grammar note 12](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlGrammar).

In Apache Jena ARQ, [`LET`](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/assignment.html) would work.
`LET` for a variable that is bound acts like a `filter`.

### Evaluation

[Substituting variables](../SEP-0007/sep-0007.md) from the LHS into the RHS (with the same
restrictions), then executing the pattern, gives the evaluation of `LATERAL`.

### Notes

There is a similarity to `filter` `NOT EXISTS`/`EXISTS` expressed as the not-legal
`FILTER ( ASK { pattern } )`, where the variables of the row being filtered are available to
"pattern". This is similar to SQL
[correlated subquery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlated_subquery).

## Spec updates

### Syntax

`LATERAL` is added to the SPARQL grammar at rule
`[[56] GraphPatternNotTriples](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rGraphPatternNotTriples)`.
As a syntax form, it is similar to `OPTIONAL`.

```
[56]  	GraphPatternNotTriples	  ::=  	GroupOrUnionGraphPattern | OptionalGraphPattern | LateralGraphPattern | ...
[57]  	OptionalGraphPattern	  ::=  	'OPTIONAL' GroupGraphPattern
[  ]  	LateralGraphPattern	  ::=  	'LATERAL' GroupGraphPattern
```

### Algebra

The new algebra operator is `lateral`, which takes two expressions:

```sparql
  SELECT * {
    ?s  ?p  ?o
    LATERAL
      { ?a  ?b  ?c }
}
```
is translated to:
```
  (lateral
    (bgp (triple ?s ?p ?o))
    (bgp (triple ?a ?b ?c)))
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate `lateral`:

1. Evaluate the first argument (left-hand side from syntax) to get a multiset of solution mappings.
2. For each solution mapping ("row"),
   a. Inject variable bindings into the second argument
   b. Evaluate this pattern
   c. Add to results

Outline:
```
Definition: Lateral

Let Ω be a multiset of solution mappings. We define:

Lateral(Ω, P) = { μ | union of Ω1 where 
           foreach μ1 in Ω:
               pattern2 = inject(pattern, μ1)
               Ω1 = eval(D(G), pattern2)
	       result Ω1
	   }
```
where `inject` is the [corrected `substitute`](https://afs.github.io/substitute.html) operation.

An alternative style is to define `Lateral` more like `evaluate P such that μ is in-scope` in some
way, rather than rely on `inject` which is a mechanism. 

```
Definition: Evaluation of Lateral

eval(D(G), Lateral(P1, P2) = Lateral(eval(D(G), P1), P2)
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a new feature with a new syntax.

Queries not using the keyword are unaffected.
