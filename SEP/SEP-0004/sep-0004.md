## Abstract

In SPARQL 1.1 the unnamed/default graph has no standard name. This means that, when writing code that manipulates graphs, one must special-case the unnamed/default graph. 

Here we propose the introduction of a URI as well as a keyword that can be used to reference the default graph specifically in both SPARQL 1.2 queries, as well as the SPARQL Protocol. The proposed standard URI for this purpose is 

(TODO reach consensus on single best URI)

- `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#defaultGraph`.
- `about:default-graph`
- `tag:w3.org,2020:default-graph`

and the proposed keyword is `DEFAULT`.

## Motivation

As raised in SPARQL 1.2 issue [#43](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/issues/43), the core problem is that the default graph is not referencable in dataset definitions. 

## Rationale and Alternatives

Various SPARQL implementations have introduced their own product-specific URIs to reference the default graph. Examples include:

| SPARQL implementation | default graph URI                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Blazegraph            | `http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#nullGraph` |
| Eclipse RDF4J         | `http://rdf4j.org/schema/rdf4j#nil`    |
| Stardog               | `tag:stardog:api:context:default`      |
| Apache Jena           | `urn:x-arq:DefaultGraph`               |
| Dydra                 | `urn:dydra:default`                    |
| Amazon Neptune        | `http://aws.amazon.com/neptune/vocab/v01/DefaultNamedGraph` |

This clearly demonstrates a pragmatic need for a way to reference the default graph. Providing a standardized identifier for this purpose will make SPARQL queries more portable across different endpoint implementations.


## Evidence of consensus

See discussion on SPARQL 1.2 issue [#43](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-12/issues/43).

## Specification:

### `DEFAULT` keyword

The `DEFAULT` keyword will be allowed to appear in several places in SPARQL queries to identify the default graph, in particular:

- `FROM DEFAULT` adds the default graph to the query's dataset definition as (part of) that dataset's default graph
- `GRAPH DEFAULT` allows SPARQL patterns to be _specifically_  matched against the default graph.

### default graph URI

The default graph URI will be usable in any place where a named graph URI is already usable. It is expected that the following query:

    SELECT ?graph WHERE { GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }} 

returns the default graph URI (assuming that default graph is not empty).
