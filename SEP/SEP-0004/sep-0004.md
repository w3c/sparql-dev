## Abstract

In SPARQL 1.1, the unnamed/default graph has no standard name. This means that, when writing code that manipulates graphs, one must special-case the unnamed/default graph. 

Here, we propose the introduction of a URI, as well as a keyword, that can be used to reference the default graph specifically, in both SPARQL queries and the SPARQL Protocol. The proposed keyword is `DEFAULT` and the proposed standard URI is 

(TODO reach consensus on single best URI)

- `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#defaultGraph`.
- `about:default-graph`
- `tag:w3.org,2020:default-graph`

## Motivation

As raised in SPARQL-dev issue [#43](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/issues/43), the core problem is that the default graph cannot be referenced in dataset definitions.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Various SPARQL implementations have introduced their own product-specific URIs to reference the default graph. Examples include:

| SPARQL implementation | default graph URI                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Blazegraph            | `http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#nullGraph` |
| Eclipse RDF4J         | `http://rdf4j.org/schema/rdf4j#nil`    |
| Stardog               | `tag:stardog:api:context:default`      |
| Apache Jena           | `urn:x-arq:DefaultGraph`               |
| Dydra                 | `urn:dydra:default`                    |
| Amazon Neptune        | `http://aws.amazon.com/neptune/vocab/v01/DefaultNamedGraph` |

This clearly demonstrates a pragmatic need for a way to reference the default graph. Providing a standardized identifier for this purpose will make SPARQL queries more portable across different endpoint implementations.

## Evidence of consensus

See discussion on SPARQL-dev issue [#43](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/issues/43).

## Specification:

### keyword `DEFAULT`

The keyword `DEFAULT` will be allowed to appear in several places in SPARQL queries to identify the default graph. In particular:

- `FROM DEFAULT` adds the default graph to the query's dataset definition as, or as part of, that dataset's default graph
- `GRAPH DEFAULT` allows SPARQL patterns to be _specifically_  matched against the default graph

### default graph URI

The default graph URI will be usable in any place where a named graph URI is already usable. It is expected that the following query will return the default graph URI (assuming that the default graph is not empty):

    SELECT ?graph WHERE { GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }}
